  bio: This is Bijendra Basnet and I am a System Architect for this project. As filmgoers, we obviously prefer good movies over bad ones, but when it comes to reviews, it's always more fun to read a tear-down of a truly crappy movie.

  bio: While movie review allows writers to express their opinions about some film or documentary, there is also the need for the unbiased and objective approach. I am trying to do something that makes other people to determine whether someone will want to see the movie or not.
