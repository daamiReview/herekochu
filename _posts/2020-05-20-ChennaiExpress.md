Chennai Express is an action comedy film serves as a charming introduction to audiences who are new to the Bollywood genre, those well studied in the history of Shah Rukh Khan movies will be most rewarded, since the screenplay  by Yunus Sajawal and songs  by Vishal-Shekhar make dozens of references to his earlier films. Khan and Padukone, reuniting after the memorable 2007 romance Om Shanti Om, are beautifully paired. 

Rohit Shetty, the director of Singham and the Golmaal comedy trilogy, confidently packs this two-and-a-half-hour film with enough laughs to keep the pace brisk.

Movie is ok to watch with family. Also, watch it only if you are looking for entertainment. Nothing else. Overall my rating is 6.5/10.
