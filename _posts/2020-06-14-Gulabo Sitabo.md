 In my opinion this movie is stretched out unnecessarily. The story is simple...Old house and cranky fight between tenants and the landlord. After watching this movie, I felt like this project should be made as 15-20 minutes short movie rather than whole 2+ hrs. movie. Feels like story was stretched too much and most of the part becomes boring. This movie is a funny satire on a typical middle-class mentality. The film portrays human inclining towards extreme greed and losing out on everything, the climax stands out and the humor infused in the film is dark and wacky. All together the film is slow paced and does not live up to its expectation. 

So, if you like fast, romantic, horror, ... movies than this movie is not definitely for you. I am going 5/10.
