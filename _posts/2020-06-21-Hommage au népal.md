Yannick and Marie visited Nepal before the powerful earthquake which occurred on April 25, 2015. They did a full tour of the country including visiting temples, an incursion into the jungle on an elephant's back in Chitwan national park, cycling in the Pokhara region, from the paraglider above the rice fields, the celebration of the birthday of Buddha at his birth place, the visit of a Tibetan refugee camp and the visit of Daskhinkali, a temple worthy of Indiana Jones . They also hiked from village to village in the Everest region, and many meetings with the Nepalese people. This film will also present you interviews with in particular Mr. Bernard Voyer, Explorer and Honorary Consul of Nepal but also, with travelers who lived through the earthquake.
