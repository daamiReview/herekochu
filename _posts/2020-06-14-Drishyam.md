A genuine gentleman's identity is not to be the successful icon but how he effectively protects his family due to the turbulent environment. Sometimes, due to too much engagement in professional development, we often forget our personal life obligations. Career achievements, unfortunately, prove futile in some unavoidable circumstances. This movie revolves around an ordinary person Vijay (Ajay Devgn) and his family who encounter with a cunning police personnel Meera (Taboo) who suspects them behind her only offspring's abduction. Throughout the movie, you will see how Vijay saves his family from this situation and finally manages to prove his innocence in the eye of law and expressed his valuable viewpoint in front of Meera. 

The story line of the is amazing. It will make you to finish this movie in one shot. Ajay and Taboo as well as those kids were the perfect choices of this role. I am going 7.5/10.
