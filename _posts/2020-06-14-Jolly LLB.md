Jolly LLB became one of the successful movie of Arshad Warsi. The plot, story, acting of each characters are very good. It's a movie that give a good social message in the society especially for the rich persons who think being poor is a curse. Arshad, Boman and Saurabh have done pure justice to their acting.

 This movie will give you full on entertainment. You can watch this movie with your family. I am going 7.0/10.
