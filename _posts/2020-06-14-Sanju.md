Sanju is a biopic of the controversial life of actor Sanjay Dutt, his film career, drug addiction, jail sentence and personal life. The performances are outstanding, Ranbir has put everything he has into this role & it's pretty evident, also Paresh Rawal & Vicky Kaushal are brilliant in the movie. Ranbir is so good in his act and performance that most of the time you feel like you are watching real Sanjay Dutt in the movie. He has not only studied Sanjay Dutt well but imbibed him in his style, appearance, facial and eyes expressions ,body language and even onomatopoeically. Perhaps it is the first Bollywood biopic of living actor which was enacted by the actor of same the time and Industry. The movie has beautifully portrait ups and downs of Sanju's life. 

Yes, it's definitely worth a watch and watch with your young kids so that they understand what the disadvantage of drugs, crime, and other bad things is. I am going 8/10 for this masterpiece.
