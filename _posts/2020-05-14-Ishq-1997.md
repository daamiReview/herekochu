 This movie is one of the full entertainment with the best comedy, part socio-political diatribe, part violent melodrama.  The story is about a rich boy and a rich girl fall in love with a poor boy and a poor girl (respectively); the rich family disapproves, and plots and schemes to separate them.  The first half of the film is full of slapstick silliness as the romances develop.  In the second half, the story turns dark, as the family's aggressive plans and the kids' desperate responses take violent shape. 

This movie is a perfect one to watch with the whole family, because it has some great scenes and it's a totally clean movie. 

Overall my rating is 8/10.
