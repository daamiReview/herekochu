The concept and story of the movie is good compared to a lot of Nepali movies. The movie is about two poor and honest friends who works daily for their living and has a dream to make their life better. From gaada owner to rickshaw owner, their poor life and the struggle to achieve their dream is presented very well in the movie. Characters in the movie have done good job on their act. 

It is very important to have a good team to make a good movie. The movie is good but due to lack of editing movie flows in unnecessary direction. Sometimes it feels like there is unnecessary background music. Ending is very poor in the movie. I think director didnâ€™t know how to finish the movie in proper way. Songs are also ok. 

I will suggest to watch this move with family. I will give this move 6/10 due to poor editing, background music and the climax of movie.
