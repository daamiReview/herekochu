If you are a fan of John 'Rambo', it's a must watch movie. It's a sequel to Rambo which was released back in 2008; it is the fifth installment in the Rambo franchise. The story is about the Vietnam War veteran, who travels to Mexico to save his adopted daughter, Gabrielle. His adopted daughter has been kidnapped by a Mexican cartel and forced into prostitution. Despite severely beaten and marked by the cartel, John is able to free Gabrielle from one of the brothels, killing several men. While driving back home in his pickup, Gabrielle dies from the forced overdose. The highlight of the movies begins in Bowie, Arizona where enraged Rambo rigs his ranch with traps for a confrontation and returns to Mexico to find Victor Martinez, one of 2 villians known as Martinez brothers. Rambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo Martinez, bother of Victor and the main leader of the cartel, leads a group of hitmen to Rambo's ranch, where each falls victim to the rigged traps. Saving Hugo for last, Rambo mutilates him and rips his heart out. For a action movie lover and John Rambo fan, this movie is definitely a must watch.
