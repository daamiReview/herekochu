The sequel of one of the biggest Nepali blockbuster movie Loot (2012), had the biggest opening day collection in the Nepali film history and became blockbuster movie later following the path of its prequal Loot. Story of Loot 2 smoothly connects with its prequal with Haku Kale plotting against his four team members to take over entire robbed money. The four gang members, who were framed for the bank robbery, now escape from the prison and want to take revenge against Haku Kale for everything that happened to them. Now that Haku Kale is no more a street don but one of the biggest crime lords of the city, the entire plot of movie revolves around the four members trying to make him pay for what he did. Story, story build and the performance of the actors especially Saugat Malla and Dayahang Rai are upto the par. My honest opinion goes in the favor of Loot than Loot 2, I found Loot more interesting and convincing over Loot 2.
