Sholay is one of the best classic, and among the greatest Hindi-language film released on 15 August 1975. This movie is one of the best bollywood movie I have ever seen and I can watch this movie over and over again. This movie is considered one of the best ever movie made in hindi cinema. This movie has everything, comedy, action, drama, romance, fun, emotions. Great performance by all the characters. Characters as Gabbar by Amjad Khan, Jai by Amitabh Bachchan, Veeru by Dharmendra, Thakur Baldev Singh by Sanjeev Kumar, Radha by Jay Bachchan and many more are simply awesome and has done fabulous acting. 

This movie is my all time favorite hindi movie and I am going with 9.5/10.
