The State vs. Jolly LL.B 2 also known as Jolly LL.B 2 is the sequel of Jolly LLB,  also became successful movie of the year. When watching this movie I did miss Arshad Warsi and the story that was presented in first movie however Akshay, Annu Kapoor, Huma, and Saurabh  have done justice to their role. The court scenes and the comedy scenes were good in the movie but the movie lagged a lot.

It is a masala, melodramatic version of first part and you can enjoy this movie with your family. I am going 7.0/10.
