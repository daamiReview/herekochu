One of my favorite movie starring [Varun Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varun_Dhawan) and [Nawazuddin Siddiqui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawazuddin_Siddiqui), with [Huma Qureshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Qureshi_(actress)), [Yami Gautam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yami_Gautam), [Vinay Pathak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinay_Pathak), [Divya Dutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divya_Dutta) and [Radhika Apte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radhika_Apte) in supporting roles. Movie was released in 2015 and directed by [Sriram Raghavan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriram_Raghavan) and produced by [Dinesh Vijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Vijan) and [Sunil Lulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Lulla) under Maddock Films. [Box Office India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Office_India) reported that *Badlapur* grossed approximately ₹78.9 crore (US$11 million) worldwide and considered as a hit movie. 

### Synopsis

Brisk and absorbing, concluding differently than expected, Badlapur is an inspired film that dangerously attempts to change the landscape of the thriller genre in Bollywood.

### Story Building:

**Story:** Raghu’s (Varun Dhawan) indefectible life is devastated, when a robbery episode kills his wife and son. The culprit Liak (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) refuses to let out the truth and is imprisoned for 20 years. Refusing to move on, Raghu harbours in him the tryst for truth. Can he avenge the deaths of people who meant the world to him? And, is being devoured by the feeling of revenge as gratifying as his volcanic rage had promised?

**Review:** Badlapur is a gobsmacking movie that suffuses on screen – a deftly written story, spectacular performances and an intelligently layered screenplay. What works best here is the film’s unpredictability. From the minute it begins, you’re latched to your seat with your heart throbbing in your mouth and your throat frequently choking up. For the sheer impact the movie conjures up, writer-director Sriram Raghavan deserves a bow!

Rating: I would give my rating of 8/10 for this movie.
