         <p>  Biwash is a Information Technology Analyst by profession. What can we say about Biwash? He loves movies, pure and simple! 
            He is a movie enthusiasts who loves watching movies and series from different genre and languages. He has nearly over a decade of experience in film criticisms and analysis. 
            Not long ago he coined what has become a “Buff” motto - “You watch a movie, it gets reviewed. Simple.” Biwash reviews a wide-breadth of movies from romantic, comedies, action/adventure, drama to horror and approaches reviews with the philosophy of their enjoyability to the casual film viewer. 
            He asks such questions, as “Is it fun?” “Does the plot have holes?” “Would you watch it again?” "Would you refer this movie to a close friend?" simple and easy from a reviewer's point of view.</p>
